Go was created at Google
The best software firm in world

Google hit a wall.
They created a language to fit their  needs.
Current languages fell short.
Also,
Major Contributors to the language are:
Ken Thompson - C, Unix, UTF-8
Rob Pike - Unix, UTF-8
Robert Griesemer - Hotspot JVM

Three Luminaries of Computer Science
Created bedrocks of the industry.

What makes Go Awesome?

The purpose of the Go Project:

Linnk to article : Go at Google: Language design

Summar:
1. Super Performant
2. C is written to run on single core
3. But Go was written to language on multiple cores
4. Go scales horizontally really well.
5. Can run concurrency really well.
6. Compiled language. It boils down to binary. There is no interpreter.
7. Garbage collected so memory management is done for you.
8. It's low level language, systems level language with a standard libray that lets you do high level things.
9. Compiles on many different OSs
10. Can compile programs to run on different architecture.
11. Backed by Google, and it's open source.

Lec 3

Go Playground
Dictates where curly brackets are
Go can be very opinionated
Does not use semicolon but compiler inserts it

fmt package

standard library
golang.org only has standard library

godoc.org also has third party packages
sorted in order of goodness, ranked by github possibly



golang.org/pkg/fmt
- change to
golang.org/src/fmt
- to see all source files for the package

notice package declaration
