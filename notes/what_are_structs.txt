it aggregates valus of different types

struct and embedded struct
https://play.golang.org/p/FFNAtakCUmy

with embedded structs
inner type gets promoted to outer type

language specs
to see how people created the language talk about it
golang.org structs

struct type
a sequence of named elements called fields
field names can be define eplicitly or implicitly
each fied has name and type
non blank field names must be unique

anonymous field must be specified as type name or pointer to type name

have to initialize promoted fields certain way

=====================
anonymous struct

anonymous because dont' have names. use this to not have code pollution
